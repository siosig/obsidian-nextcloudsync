 * value (default `latest-mtime`, persisted for virtually every user) to the same-named whole-side
 * strategy would make the whole frontmatter block be taken from one side and SILENTLY DROP array
 * union-merge for everyone — a broad regression of feature 040/043. So every migrating user (any old
 * value) converges to `merge`, which preserves the old always-semantic-merge behavior; the new merge's
 * scalar tiebreak is fixed to latest-mtime, matching the old default.
 *
 * Idempotent: a no-op once `frontmatterStrategy` is on the saved model, and for a fresh install (no old
 * key) where DEFAULT_SETTINGS already supplies `merge`. Mutates `settings`; run before
 * {@link pruneObsoleteSettings} so the obsolete key is then dropped.

 *   - `syncOnWifiOnly`      = `true`  — cellular-cost-safe default (iOS lacks the API, so effectively
 *                                        inert there, but Android honours it).
 *   - `maxFileSizeMB`       = `20`    — OOM-safe cap; the mobile WebView holds the whole file in memory.
 *   - `watchOnChangeEnabled`= `false` — mobile delivers no reliable file-change events and continuous
 *                                        syncing drains battery.
 *   - `syncIntervalMinutes` = `0`     — the mobile OS suspends background timers, so periodic sync never
 *                                        fires (see the `!Platform.isMobile` guard in
